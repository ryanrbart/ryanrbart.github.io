I am an Postdoctoral Scholar in the [Tague Ecohydrology Lab](http://tagueteamlab.org/){:target="_blank"} at the [Bren School of Environmental Science and Management](http://bren.ucsb.edu){:target="_blank"}/[Earth Research Institute](https://www.eri.ucsb.edu/){:target="_blank"} at the [University of California, Santa Barbara](http://ucsb.edu){:target="_blank"}.

# Research Interests

My research examines the linkages and feedbacks between hydrology, vegetation and disturbance with a focus on how these linkages vary under different climate regimes and management practices. I am particularly interested in understanding how wildfire and forest mortality lead to changes in forest composition/structure and the implication of these changes on water resources. My work involves examining complex coupled-systems using sophisticated (and some not so sophisticated) mechanistic and statistical models, as well as remote sensing and geospatial data.
