# About

I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in the [Tague Ecohydrology Lab](http://tagueteamlab.org/) at the [Bren School of Environmental Science and Management](http://bren.ucsb.edu) at the [University of California, Santa Barbara](http://ucsb.edu).

# Research Interests

I use ecohydrologic and statistical models to investigate the connections between environmental change, hydrology and ecosystems. A large component of my research to date has involved examining how land-cover change (e.g. fire, vegetation type-conversion), along with climate change, affects streamflow in California watersheds.
