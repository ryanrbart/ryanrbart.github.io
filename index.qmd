::: column-page

Hello! I am Ryan Bart, a scientist at the [Califonia Air Resources Board (CARB)](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/) working in the [Nature-Based Strategies Section](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/nature-based-strategies/about).
In my role at CARB, I use ecosystem modeling of present-day and future conditions to help quantify the contribution of Natural and Working Lands to California's [goal](https://lci.ca.gov/climate/carbon-neutrality.html) of carbon neutrality by 2045.

I am trained broadly as a geographer and, more specifically, as an ecohydrologistâ€”the latter being the study of how hydrological and ecological systems interact.
I am also a principal developer for [RHESSys](http://rhessys.github.io), a process-based ecohydrologic model designed to simulate feedbacks between vegetation, water, nutrients, and fire.

I was a born and raised in California, and after having lived up and down the state, I currently reside in the Sacramento region with my wife, Ana, and our two boys.
