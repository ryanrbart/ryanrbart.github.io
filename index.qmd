## Bio

Hello! I am Ryan Bart, an Assistant Professional Researcher in the [Sierra Nevada Research Institute](https://snri.ucmerced.edu/){target="_blank"} at the [University of California, Merced](https://www.ucmerced.edu/){target="_blank"}.
My research explores the linkages and feedbacks between water, vegetation, and wildfire; with a focus on how these linkages vary with climate change and forest management practices. I was a born and raised in California, and after having lived up and down the state, I currently reside in Merced with my wife, Ana, and our two boys.

## RHESSys

I am a developer for [RHESSys](https://github.com/RHESSys/RHESSys){target="_blank"}, a process-based ecohydrologic model designed to simulate water, vegetation, nutrient, and fire processes.
I also design and create tools to make modeling with RHESSys more user friendly, including the R package [RHESSysIOinR](https://github.com/RHESSys/RHESSysIOinR){target="_blank"}.

If you are interested in learning more about how to use RHESSys, I am writing a book about how to install, setup, and run simulations using the model:

-   [Ecohydrological Modeling with RHESSys](https://ryanrbart.com/rhessys_book)

I also organize a RHESSys Conference which will be held this year on 1-2 May 2024:

- [RHESSys Conference 2024](http://rhessys.github.io/conferences/conference_2024)

Looking for someone to help integrate RHESSys into your own project?
Please feel free to contact me.
I am always open to new collaborative research opportunities.
