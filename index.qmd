Hello, I’m Ryan Bart. I’m a scientist at the [California Air Resources Board (CARB)](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/), where I work in the [Nature-Based Strategies Section](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/nature-based-strategies/about).
My work focuses on ecosystem modeling—using simulations of present and future conditions to understand how California’s Natural and Working Lands contribute to the state’s goal of [carbon neutrality by 2045](https://lci.ca.gov/climate/carbon-neutrality.html).

My background is in geography broadly, and more specifically in ecohydrology—the study of how hydrological and ecological systems interact.
I’m also a principal developer for [RHESSys](http://rhessys.github.io), a process-based ecohydrologic model that explores feedbacks among vegetation, water, nutrients, and fire.

I was born and raised in California, and after having lived up and down the state, I currently reside in the Sacramento region with my wife, Ana, and our two boys.
