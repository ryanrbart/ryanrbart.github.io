### Land Management Strategies for Confronting Risks and Consequences of Wildfire

This project is examining the socio-ecological linkages between fire management actions (e.g. thinning, prescribed fire), fire risk and post-fire effects on ecosystem services such as water resources. We are linking a biophysical model, a fire spread model and an empirical model of fuels treatments with the goal of understanding how fire management practices affect landscape fuel loads, which in turn affect the likelihood of fire, which feed back to management decision-making on fuels treatments. We are also assessing the impact of fuels treatments, fire, and climate change on ecosystem processes such as streamflow and sediment production.

### Projected Climate Change Effects on Vegetation and Hydrology in California Chaparral and Sierran Conifer Ecosystems

Rising temperatures associated with climate change, as well as more frequent disturbances such as fire, are increasing the likelihood of type conversion in many regions of the western U.S. For this project, we are investigating how streamflow may respond to type conversion in two California regions, the Sierra Nevada and coastal California. In the Sierra Nevada, we are using the [Regional Hydro-Ecologic Simulation System (RHESSys)](https://github.com/RHESSys/RHESSys){:target="_blank"} model to simulate the effect of tree-to-shrub type conversion under a range of climate change scenarios at the [Southern Sierra Critical Zone Observatory](http://criticalzone.org/sierra/){:target="_blank"}. In coastal California, we are simulating the effects of shrub-to-grass type conversion on streamflow. For all simulations, field measurements of water use for different vegetation types are being used to parameterize RHESSys.

# Past Research Projects

### Wildfire and Regional-Scale Streamflow Response

Wildfire is a major source of episodic land-cover change in California watersheds and alters numerous components of the streamflow regime. For my [dissertation](/content/bart2014_dissertation.pdf){:target="_blank"}, I used a mixed-modeling statistical approach to quantify the regional effect of wildfire on annual streamflow and baseflow recession rates (i.e. low flows) in California. I also used a parsimonious storage-discharge model to provide insight into the controls on inter-seasonal baseflow recession rate variability in California.

### Basin Assessment for Regionalization (BAR) Project

This project combined satellite data (MODIS) with hydrological modeling to explore how land cover in southern California and the Western Cape Region of South Africa affects hydrological flow regimes at regional scales. My contributions included improving the prediction of flow duration curves in ungauged basins, evaluating streamflow response to wildfire in southern California and invasive vegetation in South Africa, and investigating storage configurations and parameter stability of the IHACRES rainfall-runoff model.
