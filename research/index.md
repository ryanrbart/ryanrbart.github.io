### Wildfire Management, Ecosystem Dynamics and Climate

This project examines the socio-ecological linkages between fire management actions (e.g. thinning, prescribed fire), fire risk and post-fire effects on ecosystem services such as water resources. We are linking a biophysical model, a fire spread model and an empirical model of fuels treatments with the goal of understanding how fire management practices affect landscape fuel loads, which in turn affect the likelihood of fire, which feed back to management decision-making on fuels treatments. We are also assessing the impact of fuels treatments, fire, and climate change on ecosystem processes such as streamflow and sediment production.

### Vegetation Type-Conversion and Streamflow

Rising temperatures associated with climate change, as well as more frequent disturbances such as fire, are increasing tree mortality rates in many forested regions of the western U.S. There is also evidence that many of these forests are not regenerating but instead converting to shrubs or grasses. As part of a larger project funded by the California Energy Commission, I am investigating how streamflow in California's Sierra Nevada may respond to potential tree-to-shrub type-conversion. Field measurements of water use among different tree and shrub species are being used to parameterize the <a href ="http://fiesta.bren.ucsb.edu/~rhessys/index.html">Regional Hydro-Ecologic Simulation System (RHESSys)</a> model, and simulations are being conducted under a range of type-conversion and climate change scenarios. The watersheds for this project are located at the <a href ="http://criticalzone.org/sierra/">Southern Sierra Critical Zone Observatory</a>.

# Former Research Projects

### Wildfire and Regional-Scale Streamflow Response

Wildfire is a major source of episodic land-cover change in California watersheds and alters numerous components of the streamflow regime. For this project, a mixed-modeling statistical approach was used to quantify the regional effect of wildfire on annual streamflow and baseflow recession rates (i.e. low flows) in California. In addition, a parsimonious storage-discharge model was used to provide insight into the first-order control on baseflow recession rates, antecedent aquifer storage.

### Basin Assessment for Regionalization (BAR) Project

This project assimilated satellite data (MODIS) with hydrological modeling to explore how land cover in southern California and the Western Cape Region of South Africa affects hydrological regimes at regional scales. The multiple components of this project included improving predictions of flow duration curves in ungauged basins, evaluating streamflow response to fire in southern California and invasive vegetation in South Africa, and investigating storage configurations and parameter stability of the IHACRES rainfall-runoff model.
