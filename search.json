    "text": "Hello! I am Ryan Bart, a scientist at the Califonia Air Resources Board (CARB) working in the Nature-Based Strategies Section. At CARB, I use ecosystem modeling of present-day and future conditions to help quantify the contribution of Natural and Working Lands to Californiaâ€™s goal of carbon neutrality by 2045.\nMy background is in geography broadly, and more specifically in ecohydrology-the study of how hydrological and ecological systems interact. I am also a principal developer for RHESSys, a process-based ecohydrologic model designed to simulate feedbacks between vegetation, water, nutrients, and fire.\nI was a born and raised in California, and after having lived up and down the state, I currently reside in the Sacramento region with my wife, Ana, and our two boys."
