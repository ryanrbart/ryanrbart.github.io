    "text": "Ecohydrology and Climate Change\nClimate change is already altering water, vegetation, and wildfire on our natural lands. An increasing percentage of precipitation in our mountains falls as rain instead of snow, shifting the timing of streamflow. Higher temperatures are increasing vegetation water stress, making forests more vulnerable to drought. Higher temperatures are also decreasing fuel moisture, making our natural lands easier to burn.\nBecause climate change alters water, vegetation, and fire; predicting the effects of climate change can get complicated. - Often requires a systems approach and processed based modeling, since the recent past doesn’t provide…\nrequires understanding the interactions between the processes.\nThe effects of climate change on vegetation\nAn example of the type of climate-change related research questions we investigate in the lab include:\n\nResearch Questions:\n\nHow does climate-induced changes in drought and wildfire lead to changes in vegetation composition/structure and what are the implication of these changes on watershed hydrology?"

    "text": "The Bart Ecohydrology Lab is based in the Sierra Nevada Research Institute at the University of California, Merced. Ecohydrology is the study of how hydrological and ecological systems interact. Ecohydrology is important because water availability and vegetation growth are tightly coupled, particularly in water-limited environments such as California. Changes to the ecohydrologic functioning of a watershed has implications for forest health, carbon sequestration, water resources, and fire risk.\nResearch in the lab is used to advance scientific understanding, generate decision-support tools, and to inform policy. While the lab’s research is frequently based in the Sierra Nevada and California, we have research projects throughout North America and the world. We use a mix of tools, including biophysical models, statistical models, and remote sensing.\nResearch in the lab focuses on three broad domains.\n\nEcoinformatics\nEcoinformatics is the science of using computational tools and data analysis to investigate ecological systems. We use ecoinformatics to generate novel approaches for investigating water, carbon, and nutrient fluxes.\n\nEcohydrology and Disturbance\nEcosystem disturbances come in many types, including wildfire, bark beetles, drought, and forest management. We examine how disturbances alter ecohydrologic functioning, ranging from vegetation resilience to water supply for human communities.\n\nEcohydrology and Climate Change\nClimate change affects many ecohydrologic processes, altering functioning in ways that are not always obvious and sometimes counterintuitive. We are interested in predicting the effects of climate change and understanding how management actions can be used to mitigate its worse consequences."
