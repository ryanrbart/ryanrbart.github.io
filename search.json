    "text": "Hello, I’m Ryan Bart. I’m a scientist at the California Air Resources Board (CARB), where I work in the Nature-Based Strategies Section. My work focuses on ecosystem modeling—using simulations of present and future conditions to understand how vegetation in California’s Natural and Working Lands contribute to the state’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2045.\nMy background is in geography broadly, and more specifically in ecohydrology—the study of how hydrological and ecological systems interact. I’m also a principal developer for RHESSys, a process-based ecohydrologic model that explores feedbacks among vegetation, water, nutrients, and fire.\nI was born and raised in California, and after having lived up and down the state, I currently reside in the Sacramento region with my wife, Ana, and our two boys."
