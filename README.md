## Publishing website
This website is made using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and [Github
Pages](https://pages.github.com/). After making changes to the website content,
it can be published to Github using Quarto publish command [(See details here)](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages). Specifically, you can type:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto publish gh-pages
```

in the terminal. Make sure git is on the branch with your content (i.e. master)
and not on gh-pages.
